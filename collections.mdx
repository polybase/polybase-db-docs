Collections are similar to a table in a traditional database.
You must create a collection before adding data to Polybase. 

Collections (aka database tables) define the fields and rules for a collection
of records. All records created by a collection are guaranteed to follow the
rules of that collection. This is in contrast to other smart contract languages,
where only a single record can be associated with a collection.

Each Polybase record within a collection has its own unique identifier `id`.

You can view our example app
[Polybase Social](https://social.testnet.polybase.xyz) to see it working in
action.

## Create a collection

You can create a collection using the client library and calling the `applySchema` method on your 

```js
import { Polybase } from "@polybase/client"

const db = new Polybase({ defaultNamespace: "your-namespace" })

// If you want to edit the contract code in the future,
// you must sign the request when calling applySchema for the first time
db.signer((data) => {
  return {
    h: 'eth-personal-sign',
    sig: ethPersonalSign(wallet.privateKey()), data)
  }
})

const createResponse = await db.applySchema(`
  collection CollectionName {
    id: string;
    country?: string;
    publicKey?: string;

    @index(country);

    constructor (id: string, country: string) {
      this.id = id;
      this.country = country;

      // Assign the public key of the user making the request to this record
      this.publicKey = ctx.publicKey;
    }
  }
`, 'your-namespace') // your-namespace is optional if you have defined a default namespace
```

<Info>
  If you want your contract code to be updatable, then you need to ensure that
  you [sign the request](https://docs.polybase.xyz/write#signing-requests) when
  creating the contract (the first time you call `.applySchema()`)
</Info>

<Warning>
  `id` field is mandatory on all collections, and you must assign an `id` using
  `this.id = ...` within the `constructor` function.
</Warning>

## Define a Collection

Collections are defined using Polylang (the language for Polybase), that is very
similar to Javascript/Typescript. Collections allow you define the rules and
indexes for your collection records. The following is a valid collection
definition.

```js
collection CollectionName {
  id: string;
  name?: string;

  constructor (id: string, name: string) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
  }

  @index(name);
}
```

The above would allow you to insert a record with a `name` property of type
`string`.


### Constructor

The collection `constructor` function is called whenever you add new records to the the database. 
The constructor function must assign `this.id` and any additional required fields defined in your collection.. An error will be returned if A
record with the assinged `id` is provided.


### Fields

You can specify the fields that are allowed in your collection. These should be
at the top most part of your collection. A collection should always have an `id`
field. By default, all fields are required.

```js
collection CollectionName {
  id: string;
  age: number;

  ...
}
```

<Info>Additional types such as arrays, maps and dates will be added soon.</Info>

#### Optional Fields

All fields are required by default, if you want to make a field optional simply
append `?` after the field name and before the `:`. For example:

```js
collection CollectionName {
  id: string;
  required: number;
  optional?: number;

  ...
}
```

### Functions

Field values can only be modified using functions.

```js
collection Account {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  balance: number;
  publicKey: string;

  constructor (name: string) {
    this.id = ctx.publicKey;
    this.name = name;
    this.publicKey = ctx.publicKey;
    this.balance = 0;
  }

  // Fn ignores all above rules, so anything needed must be reimplemented
  transfer (b: record, amount: number) {
    # ctx is in global scope of fn
    # error() is in global scope of fn
    if (this.publicKey == ctx.publicKey) {
       throw error('invalid user');
    }

    # can edit both records
    this.balance -= amount
    b.balance += amount

    // min has to be reimplemented/declared b/c field @ rules do not apply
    // inside fns
    if (a.balance < 0) {
      throw error('insufficient balance');
    }
  }
}
```

You can call your custom functions using `.call(functionName, args)`:

```js
const db = new Polybase({ defaultNamespace: "your-namespace" });
const col = db.collection("account");
await col.record("id1").call("transfer", [c.record("id2"), 10]);
```

### Calling other collections

You can define a parameter of a function to accept a record from another collection, allowing you 
to perform atomic updates to multiple records from different collections.

```js 
collection Account {
  id: string;
  name?: string;

  constructor (id: string, counter: Counter) {
    this.id = ctx.publicKey;
    counter.incr()
  }
}

collection Counter {
  id: string;
  count: number;

  constructor (id: string) {
    this.id = id;
    this.count = 0;
  }

  incr () {
    this.count += 1;
  }
}
```


### Indexes

Indexes are a list of fields in addition to the record's `id` field that should
be indexed. You need to ensure that all fields that are included in a `where` or
`sort` clause are included in the indexes.

```js
const db = new Polybase({ defaultNamespace: "your-namespace" });
const collectionReference = db.collection("cities");
const records = await collectionReference.where("name", "==", "abc").get();
```

You would need the following schema:

```js
collection cities {
  name: string;

  @index(name);

  ...
}
```

If you want to order your results, you also need to include that in the index:

```js
const db = new Polybase({ defaultNamespace: "your-namespace" });
const collectionReference = db.collection("cities");
const records = await collectionReference
  .where("name", "==", "abc")
  .sort("population", "desc")
  .get();
```

You would need the following schema:

```js
collection cities {
  name: string;
  population: number;

  @index(name, [population, desc]);
}
```

## Reference a collection

To reference a collection, you can call `.collection("collection-name")` on your
Polybase instance. The returned collection instance relates to a specific
collection of data and allows you [.write()](/write) and [.read()](/read) data
from Polybase.

#### Relative Path (with default namespace)

The following would return a collection with path: `your-namespace/cities`:

```js
const db = new Polybase({ defaultNamespace: "your-namespace" });
const collection = db.collection("cities");
```

#### Relative Path (without default namespace)

The following would return a collection with path: `your-namespace/cities`:

```js
const db = new Polybase();
const collection = db.collection("your-namespace/cities");
```

#### Absolute Path

To override the default namespace, you can use an absolute path by specifying a
`/` at the start of the path.

The following would return a collection with path: `alt-namespace/cities`:

```js
const db = new Polybase({ defaultNamespace: "your-namespace" });
const collection = db.collection("/alt-namespace/cities");
```
