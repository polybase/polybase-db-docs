title: "Known Issues"

Polybase is currently in alpha. We appreciate your patience while we add
functionality and address these issues. Please report any issues in
[Discord](https://discord.gg/DrXkRpCFDX).


## Limitation on indexing maps and arrays
Currently, Polybase does not support indexing of elements of maps or arrays.
This means that you will not be able to use `where` or `sort` on the elements
in these types. 

Example: 

If you have a schema such as: 

```js
collection User {
    id: string;
    details: map<string, string>;
    adresses: string[]
}
```

You will not be able to add `details` or `addresses` to the index

```js
collection User {
    id: string;
    details: map<string, string>;

    @index(details, adresses) //  DOES NOT WORK
}
```
You also will not be able to add elements of `details` or `addresses`

```js
collection User {
    id: string;
    details: map<string, string>;

    @index(details['name'], adresses[0]) //  DOES NOT WORK
}
```



## Limitations on optional types in maps
Currently Polybase does not support `null` values in maps.
If you have an optional value that may not exist, you must still provide a 
value for the key or omit the type. 

Example:

If you have a schema such as: 

```js
collection User {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    details: map<string, string>;
}
```

You must provide a value for all fields in details or omit it

```js
// User provided an email but not a phone number
const userName = 'John Doe'
const userEmail = 'john.doe@polybase.xyz'
const userPhone = null

const collectionReference = db.collection("User")

// DOES NOT WORK
const recordData = await collectionReference.create([userName, {email: userEmail, phone: userPhone}]) 

// WORKS
const recordData = await collectionReference.create([userName, {email: userEmail, phone: ""}]) 

// WORKS
const recordData = await collectionReference.create([userName, {}])

```
