```js
const db = new Polybase({ defaultNamespace: "your-namespace" });
const collectionReference = db.collection("cities");
const records = await collectionReference
  .where("name", "==", "abc")
  .where("country", "==", "UK")
  .get();
```

You would need the following schema:

```js
@public
collection cities {
  name: string;
  country: string;

  @index(name, country);

  ...
}
```

If you want to order your results, you also need to include that in the index:

```js
const db = new Polybase({ defaultNamespace: "your-namespace" });
const collectionReference = db.collection("cities");
const records = await collectionReference
  .where("name", "==", "abc")
  .sort("population", "desc")
  .get();
```

You would need the following schema:

```js
@public
collection cities {
  name: string;
  country: string;
  population: number;

  @index(name, [population, desc]);
}
```
