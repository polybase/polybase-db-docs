### Added

  - Nested fields are now indexable, you can now filter and sort by them.

### Fixed

  - @polybase/client's applySchema now re-throws errors


## \[0.3.18\] - 2023-01-05

### Added

  - All fields are now indexed by default. This means that all fields can be queried and sorted without defining an explicit index

## \[0.3.15\] - 2022-12-30

### Fixed

  - Change global namespace for `@polybase/client` to `polybase` when importing using the global namespace (i.e when using a CDN). It was incorrectly set to `polybase_util`

### Added
 
  - Allow records from other collections in the same scope to be passed to functions
  - Allow calling methods on records from other collections


## \[0.3.14\] - 2022-12-30

### Added

 - Added `map` and `array` type to Polylang, collections can now have a map and array field when defining the collection.


## \[0.3.13\] - 2022-12-30

### Added

 - Export minified umd format for cdn import

## \[0.3.12\] - 2022-12-20

### Changed

 - Update dependencies


## \[0.3.11\] - 2022-12-20

### Changed

 - Only call signer function (fn provided by `.signer(fn)`) for write requests (previously the signer fn was called for both read and write requests, 
 which led to a poor user experience if using metamask to sign requests).


## \[0.3.10\] \- 2022-11-23

### Added

- Added additional encryption algorithems:
  - aes-cbc (symmetric encryption)
  - secp256k1 (Ethereum signing/asymmetric encryption)
  - x25519-xsalsa20-poly1305 (MetaMask encryption)

### Changed

- Utility fns should now be imported by algorithm name: e.g
  `import { aescbc, secp256k1, x25519xsalsa20poly1305 } from '@polybase/util'`

### Deprecated

- Default export of encryption functions (these fns can now be imported using
  the algorithm specific import - see above):
  - `import { asymmetricEncrypt, asymmetricDecrypt } from '@polybase/client'`
  - `import { encryptToHex, decryptFromHex } from '@polybase/client'`
  - `import { asymmetricEncryptToHex, asymmetricDecryptFromHex } from '@polybase/client'`
  - `import { sign } from '@polybase/client'`

## \[0.3.7\] \- 2022-11-14

### Added

- Added symmetric encryption helpers to `@polybase/util`:
  - `symmetricGenerateKey()`
  - `symmetricDecryptFromHex()`
  - `symmetricEncrypt()`
  - `symmetricDecrypt()`
  - `symmetricImportKey()`

### Changed

- Normalized asymmetric encryption helpers in `@polybase/util`:
  - `encryptToHex()` \-> `asymmetricEncryptToHex()`
  - `decryptFromHex()` \-> `asymmetricDecryptFromHex()`

### Deprecated

- Deprecated from `@polybase/util`:
- `encrypt()`
- `decrypt()`

## \[0.3.6\] \- 2022-11-11

  - `POST /v0/collections/{collectionId}/documents/{recId}/call/{function}`
    replaced by
    `POST /v0/collections/{collectionId}/records/{recId}/call/{function}`

### Changed

- Nomenclature for a record/document within a collection has been changed from
  document -> record
- Error `reason` codes returned from the server have been updated to the
  follows:
  - `record/not-found`

## \[0.3.3\] \- 2022-11-04

### Removed

- `pk` (publicKey) is no longer accepted as the final parameter of
  .call(functionName, args, ~~pk~~)\` and .create(args, ~~pk~~)

### Changed

- Signer function has new type specification:
  `type Signer = (data: string, req: Request) => Promise<SignerResponse|null>`
  - Additional parameter `req: Request` is passed as the second parameter
  - If provided, `signer()` is called for every request
  - You can return null on `Signer` function if you do not want to provide a
    signature for a given request
- Dependencies updates

## \[0.3.2\] \- 2022-11-04

### Fixed

  `db.collection('HelloWorld').create(["id1"])`
- Changelog added to documentation

### Removed

- `doc.set()` \- replaced by creating specific collection functions that can be
  called using `doc.call("fn", args)`
- `doc.delete()` \- replaced by `selfdestruct()`, which should be called within
  a smart collection function
- Field directives (e.g. `@max()`, `@min()`, etc) have been removed

### Deprecated

- The following URL endpoints have been deprecated from our hosted service:
  - `GET /v0/collections/{collectionId}/records` replaced by
    `GET /v0/collections/{collectionId}`
  - `GET /v0/collections/{collectionId}/records/{recId}` replaced by
    `GET /v0/collections/{collectionId}/{recId}`

## \[0.1.0\] \- 2022-09-01
