# Collections

Collections are similar to a table in a traditional database.
You must create a collection before adding data to Polybase DB. 

Collections (aka database tables) define the fields and rules for a collection
of records. All records created by a collection are guaranteed to follow the
rules of that collection. This is in contrast to other smart contract languages,
where each smart contract is equivalent to a single record.

Each Polybase DB record within a collection has its own unique identifier `id` which must be of type `string`.

You can view our example app
[Polybase DB Social](https://social.testnet.polybase.xyz) to see it working in
action.

## Create a collection

<Callout type="warning">
  `contract` may **not** be used as an identifier (collection name, field name, function name, etc.).
  Also, JavaScript reserved words and keywords may **not** be used as identifiers. 
  Please refer to the full list of [JavaScript reserved words](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-keywords-and-reserved-words).
</Callout>

### Create collection using the Explorer (recommended)

Navigate to the [Explorer](https://explorer.testnet.polybase.xyz), and click on "Create Collection". You will then be prompted to sign in.

If you create a collection in the explorer, the collection will be owned by the account you used to sign in.


### Create collection programmatically

To create a schema programatically, you can use the `applySchema` method on your Polybase DB client instance.

In this example, we create a collection called `City` that has `name` and `country` fields, and a `setCountry()` function. You can define multiple collections in a single `applySchema` call.

```js
import { Polybase } from "@polybase/client"

const db = new Polybase({ defaultNamespace: "your-namespace" })

await db.applySchema(`
  @public
  collection City {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    country?: string;

    constructor (id: string, name: string) {
      this.id = id;
      this.name = name;
    }

    setCountry (country: string) {
      this.country = country;
    }
  }

  @public
  collection Country {
    id: string;
    name: string;

    constructor (id: string, name: string) {
      this.id = id;
      this.name = name;
    }
  }
`,
  "your-namespace"
); // your-namespace is optional if you have defined a default namespace
```

<Callout type="warning">
  If you use `applySchema` you will need to sign the request [sign the request](/guides/write-data#signing-requests), and
  ensure that your namespace is in the format `pk/0x<hex_encoded_64_byte_public_key>/whatever-namespace-you-want`. Where the 64 byte public key
  is the public key being used to sign the request.
</Callout>


```js
import { Polybase } from "@polybase/client"

const db = new Polybase({ defaultNamespace: "your-namespace" })

// If you want to edit the contract code in the future,
// you must sign the request when calling applySchema for the first time
db.signer((data) => {
  return {
    h: 'eth-personal-sign',
    sig: ethPersonalSign(wallet.privateKey()), data)
  }
})

const createResponse = await db.applySchema(`
  @public
  collection CollectionName {
    id: string;
    country?: string;
    publicKey?: PublicKey;

    constructor (id: string, country: string) {
      this.id = id;
      this.country = country;

      // Assign the public key of the user making the request to this record
      if (ctx.publicKey)
        this.publicKey = ctx.publicKey;
    }
  }
`, 'your-namespace') // your-namespace is optional if you have defined a default namespace
```

<Callout type="warning">
  `id` field is unique and mandatory on all collections, and you must assign an `id` using
  `this.id = ...` within the `constructor` function.
</Callout>

## Define a Collection

Collections are defined using Polylang (the language for Polybase DB), that is very
similar to Javascript/TypeScript. Collections allow you define the rules and
indexes for your collection records. The following is a valid collection
definition.

```typescript
@public
collection CollectionName {
  // id is mandatory on all collections and must be unique
  id: string;
  // name is defined as required
  name: string;
  // age is defined as optional
  age?: number;

  constructor (id: string, name: string, age?: number) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  // Only required for multi-field indexes, as each field is
  // automatically indexed
  @index(name, age);
}
```

The above would allow you to insert/create a record with a `name` of type `string` and optional `age` property of type
`number`.


### Constructor

The collection `constructor` function lets you **create new records** in your collection, and is called when you create a record. 
The constructor function must assign `this.id` and any additional required fields defined in your collection. An error will be returned if a
record already exists with the assigned `id` is provided, as each record in a collection must have a unique `id`.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Polybase DB functions have a 5 second timeout period.
</Callout>


### Fields

You can specify the fields that are allowed in your collection. These should be
at the top most part of your collection. A collection should always have a `id`
field (`id` is unique). By default, all fields are required.

```typescript
@public
collection CollectionName {
  id: string;
  age: number;

  ...
}
```

#### id Field

The `id` fields is required on every Polybase DB collection. It must be assigned in the constructor. Each record must have a unique `id` across the entire collection. `id` must be of type `string`.

<Callout type="info">
  You will soon be able to use other types as the `id` field.
</Callout>

#### Nested Fields

You can also define nested fields:

```typescript
@public
collection User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  address: {
    street: string;
    city: string;
    state: string;
    zip: number;
  };
}
```

#### Optional Fields

All fields are required by default, if you want to make a field optional simply
append `?` after the field name and before the `:`. For example:

```typescript
@public
collection CollectionName {
  id: string;
  required: number;
  optional?: number;

  ...
}
```

You can also pass in optional values to function parameters, for example:

```typescript
@public
collection CollectionName {
  id: string;
  required: number;
  optional?: number;

  constructor (id: string, required: number, optional?: number) {
    this.id = id;
    this.required = required;
    this.optional = optional;
  }
}
```


### Field Types

The following types are supported:

- `string`
- `number`
- `boolean`
- `bytes`
- `PublicKey`
- `Collection`
- `string[]`, `number[]`, `boolean[]`, `PublicKey[]` and `Collection*[]`
- `map<string | number, T>`

Where `Collection*` is the name of a specific collection in the same namespace.

Here are some examples of fields being defined:

```typescript
@public
collection User {
  id: string;
  age: number;
  alive: boolean;
  icon: bytes;
  publicKey: PublicKey;
  bestFriend: User;
  friends: User[];
  currency: map<string, number>;
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  Additional types such as dates will be added soon.
</Callout>

#### Primitives

The following primitive types are supported:

 - `string`
 - `number`
 - `boolean`

#### Bytes

The bytes type allows you to store arbitary bytes in Polybase DB, without having to encode the data as a string. 

If you use our client library [`@polybase/client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@polybase/client), the bytes type will be returned as a `Uint8Array`. 

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
`bytes` data is currently not indexed
</Callout>


#### Collection

`Collection` fields reference another collection in the same namespace. This allows you to create relationships between records in the same or different collections. 
Similar to how you have relationships in SQL.

You can define the field on the collection, and then also pass a parameter as a `Collection` type.

```typescript
@public 
collection Pet {
  id: string;

  // This field is referencing the User collection below
  owner: User;

  constructor (id: string, owner: User) {
    this.id = id;
    this.owner = owner;
  }
}

@public
collection User {
  id: string;
  ...
}
```

You can then call the constructor using `create()` passing in the reference to a specific record of that collection:

<Tabs items={['js', 'curl']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```js
  import { Polybase } from "@polybase/client";

  const db = new Polybase({
    defaultNamespace: "your-namespace",
  });

  db.collection('Pet').create(
    [
      "pet1", 
      // This is referencing the User collection
      db.collection('User').record("user1")
    ]
  );
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```bash
  curl -X POST \
    https://testnet.polybase.xyz/v0/collections/your_namespace%2FPet/records \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
      "args": [
        "pet1",
        {
          "collectionId": "your_namespace/Pet",
          "id": "user1"
        }
      ]
  }'
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>


#### Public Key

The `PublicKey` type is a special type that is used to represent a public key. Currently, we only support Ethereum (`secp256k1`) public keys.

**`.toHex()`**

If you need a string hex representation of the public key, you can use `this.publicKey.toHex()`. This will return a string starting with `0x`, 
and the hexidecimal representation of the 64 byte public key.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Public keys on Polybase DB use non-prefixed Public Keys, so they are 64 bytes long.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  We will be adding support for [Falcon](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1041.pdf), this is a zk optimized PublicKey
 </Callout>

#### Arrays

You can create arrays of `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `PublicKey` and `Collection` type. For example:

```typescript
@public
collection User {
  id: string;
  codes: string[];
  ages: number[];
  attempts: boolean[];
  friends: User[];
  keys: PublicKey[];
}
```

You can initialize an array with a default value, as you would normally do in JavaScript, and push items on to the array.

```typescript
@public
collection User {
  id: string;
  codes: string[];

  constructor () {
    this.codes = [];
  }

  addCode (code: string) {
    this.codes.push(code);
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Array fields are not currently indexed
</Callout>


#### Maps

You can create map, these allow you to create key value pairs. For example:

```typescript
@public
collection User {
  id: string;
  currency: map<string, number>

  constructor () {
    this.currency = {};
  }

  setUSD (val: number) {
    this.currency["USD"] = val;
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Map fields are not currently indexed
</Callout>


### Functions

Field values can only be modified using functions.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Polybase DB functions have a 5 second timeout period.
</Callout>

```typescript
@public
collection Account {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  balance: number;
  publicKey: PublicKey;

  constructor (name: string) {
    this.id = ctx.publicKey.toHex();
    this.name = name;
    this.publicKey = ctx.publicKey;
    this.balance = 0;
  }

  // Fn ignores all above rules, so anything needed must be reimplemented
  transfer (b: Account, amount: number) {
    //ctx is in global scope of fn
    // error() is in global scope of fn
    if (this.publicKey == ctx.publicKey) {
       throw error('invalid user');
    }

    // can edit both records
    this.balance -= amount
    b.balance += amount

    // min has to be reimplemented/declared b/c field @ rules do not apply
    // inside fns
    if (a.balance < 0) {
      throw error('insufficient balance');
    }
  }
}
```

You can call your custom functions using `.call(functionName, args)`:

```js
const db = new Polybase({ defaultNamespace: "your-namespace" });
const col = db.collection("account");
await col.record("id1").call("transfer", [c.record("id2"), 10]);
```

### Context

The global variable `ctx` is available inside any Polybase DB function. 

#### Public Key

`ctx.publicKey` is populated when you provide a `signer` function to the Polybase DB client.

```js
import { Polybase } from '@polybase/client'
import { ethPersonalSign } from '@polybase/eth'

const db = new Polybase({
  signer: (data) => {
    return {
      h: 'eth-personal-sign',
      sig: ethPersonalSign(wallet.privateKey()), data)
    }
  })
})
```

You can then use the `publicKey` of the wallet used to sign the request
in your collection code, for example see how in `setName` we check the `ctx.publicKey` and compare 
it against the records own `publicKey`:

```typescript
collection CollectionName {
  id: string;
  name?: string;
  publicKey?: PublicKey;

  constructor (id: string) {
    this.id = id;
    if (ctx.publicKey)
      this.publicKey = ctx.publicKey;
  }

  setName (name: string) {
    if (this.publicKey != ctx.publicKey) {
      error("you do not have permission to do that");
    }
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

##### `.toHex()`

If you need a string hex representation of the public key, you can use `ctx.publicKey.toHex()`. This will return a string starting with `0x`, 
and the hexidecimal representation of the 64 byte public key.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Public keys on Polybase DB use non-prefixed Public Keys, so they are 64 bytes long.
</Callout>


### Indexes

Indexes are a list of fields in addition to the record's `id` field that should
be indexed. You need to ensure that all fields that are included in a `where` or
`sort` clause are included in the indexes.

All collection fields are automatically indexed, which means
you only need to specify multi-field indexes.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Fields of type Collection must be indexed explicitly `@index(collectionField)`.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Indexing array/map fields is currently not possible.
</Callout>

<MultiFieldIndex />

## Permissions

By default, collections in Polybase DB are private and their records cannot be accessed.
To make a collection public, add the `@public` directive.

To allow users to access and manipulate their records, you can use the following directives:

<PublicOnCollections />
<ReadOnCollections />
<ReadOnFields />
<CallOnCollections />
<CallOnFunctions />

### `@delegate`

<Desc />
<DelegateRead />

For more on delegating permissions, see [Delegating Permissions](/guides/permissions#delegate).

## Reference a collection

To reference a collection, you can call `.collection("collection-name")` on your
Polybase DB instance. The returned collection instance relates to a specific
collection of data and allows you [.write()](/guides/write-data) and [.read()](/guides/read-data) data
from Polybase DB.

#### Relative Path (with default namespace)

The following would return a collection with path: `your-namespace/cities`:

```js
const db = new Polybase({ defaultNamespace: "your-namespace" });
const collection = db.collection("cities");
```

#### Relative Path (without default namespace)

The following would return a collection with path: `your-namespace/cities`:

```js
const db = new Polybase();
const collection = db.collection("your-namespace/cities");
```

#### Absolute Path

To override the default namespace, you can use an absolute path by specifying a
`/` at the start of the path.

The following would return a collection with path: `alt-namespace/cities`:

```js
const db = new Polybase({ defaultNamespace: "your-namespace" });
const collection = db.collection("/alt-namespace/cities");
```
